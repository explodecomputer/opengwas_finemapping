# Finemapping across the OpenGWAS database

1. Read in the 20k AFL2 SNPs from the VCF files
2. Determine most likely ancestry from the 20k AFL2 SNPs
3. Read in the top hits from the VCF files
4. Read in the ldetect mappings for the correct ancestry
5. Assign top hits to regions
6. Finemap each region using appropriate 1000 genomes dataset
7. Save SuSiE results
